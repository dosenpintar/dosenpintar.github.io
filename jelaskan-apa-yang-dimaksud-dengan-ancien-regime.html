                                            THE ECONOMIC GROWTH AND THE REGIONAL CHARACTERISTICS: THE CASE OF INDONESIA
Indonesia’s economic growth is quite high but the effect on its people is low and raises questions about the influence of the regional characteristics on economic growth. The research of Sodik et al (2007) stated that the overall pattern of a region’s capacity is a result of the nature of social and economic environment that determines the pattern of activity in achieving objectives reflected in regional characteristics which influence economic growth in the form of aspects or qualities consisting of regional labor force, population, human capital (education), inflation and net exports.
Employment is a very important aspect to be studied. Countries with a very large number of people and the provision of limited employment opportunities face serious problems with unemployment. Developments in the labor force cannot be separated from the rate of population growth in the region. Tjiptoherijanto (2001) stated that during the period 1997-1999, the total work force in Indonesia tended to increase, either in working or looking for work. When viewed between the number of people working and those looking for work, it turned out the working population was relatively larger than those looking for work, but the increase was much higher for those in the population who are looking for work. In the construction, local residents often serve as a source of labor which addresses the problem of employment. Thus, with a population increase in Indonesia from year to year, while the number of jobs available can lead to limited competition, job seekers are threatened by the lack of opportunity and fulfillment of well-being by fear of increased poverty. As revealed by Ngangi (2010), overcoming poverty is not an easy task but it is closely related to life issues such as the state of the environment, a social activity, education level and health status. The quality of labor is reflected in part by the improvement of education. The higher the formal education obtained; the labor productivity tended to be higher as well. This is consistent with the theory of human capital (human capital). 
Sendouw (2006) stated that as a country, Indonesia is one country that has the greatest natural resources in the world, but it has not guaranteed improved welfare of its society. Nor is the use of its resources dependent on the age of the country, but reflected in the attitudes and behavior follow the principle - the basic principle of life. Attitudes and behaviors exhibited The Economic Growth and The Regional Characteristics : The Case of Indonesia 5 by human beings can be formed through a process of learning, especially in formal education, thus human capital follows the basic principles of life. 
The phenomenon of inflation in Indonesia has become one of the various “diseases” of the government macroeconomic which is especially troubling for the community. Towards the end of the New Order regime (before the financial crisis) the annual inflation rate could be reduced to the single digits, but in general it still contained vulnerability when seen from the large percentage of poor communities suffering from inflation. 
Since 1967, Indonesia tried to open up. Changing from an isolated system to an open system contains a dubious advantage. Indonesian net export value fluctuated over 2 decades and during the period from 2005 to 2010, Indonesia’s trade balance (net exports) experienced a trade surplus. Based on a review of several indicators of regional characteristics, the required study group should have similar characteristics as the region in order to gain an overall understanding of the factors that can be determined and identified through the analysis which presumably can spur economic growth in establishing a region.

                                            A. Read the following passage, and answer the questions that follow.
Myanmar state radio and television announced Tuesday that (1) the country's president as granted amnesty to more than 6,300 prisoners in what appears to be the biggest step so far in a series of reform actions undertaken by the new elected government.
(2)The broadcasts said the releases would begin Wednesday - a religious holiday - but did not specify how many political detainees were among the 6,59 receiving an amnesty from President Thein Sein. The president set the decision after (3) he had a meeting with the UN. The release of at least some of the country's estimated 2,000 political prisoners has been hotly anticipated as a crucial step in liberalizing measures implemented by the military-backed but elected government that took power in March.
Most prominent political prisoners are held in facilities far from the country's main city of Yangon, a policy implemented under the previous military regime apparently to limit (4) their ability to communicate through visiting family members and lawyers.
The broadcast said a list of the prisoners had been prepared, but did not read out. Myanmar's tightly controlled state newspapers had published an appeal Tuesday morning for a release of political prisoners, a sign that the move had official blessing.
The appeal in the three state newspapers, which closely reflect government positions, was an open letter from the government-appointed National Human Rights Commission calling on Thein Sein to grant an amnesty as a gesture of magnanimity.
Myanmar's long-ruling military government handed power in March to an elected administration, which is seen as remaining closely aligned with the military but which has declared (5) its  intention to liberalize the country's hard line policies.
The United States believes Myanmar's elections were flawed but has been encouraged by its liberalizing trend since the civilian administration took power, the highest-ranking American diplomat for Asia said Monday.

More recently, the city of Aleppo has just bombarded by the Assad regime. Many hospitals there have also been affected. Really depressing for me, seeing the nurses there moving the patients to a safer place. Even newborns had to be moved from their incubators for their safety. It's pathetic.
All of those things makes me feel very grateful for this life. sometimes I like to complain about my life. Even about the smallest thing. In fact, out there, there are still many children with a body  and eyes swollen with tears, sit calmly in the refugee camps. He only thinking about one thing, When is all this going to end?</a>

                                            Text 1 Fort Rotterdam is located in the heart of Makassar. It was used by the Dutch East Indies regime as their military base to maintain their power in Makassar. Fort Rotterdam is rectangular. To protect the fort, six bulwarks, namely Bastion Bonie, Bastion Boeton, Bastion Batjang, Bastion Mandassar, Bastion Ravelin (not visible anymore), and Bastion Amboina, were built around the fort to protect it. Today, inside the fort, we can find La Galigo Museum which stores many relics of the kingdoms in Sulawesi island. The fort is well-preserved to attract visitors. The most interesting place in this fort is a room where Prince Diponegoro was imprisoned for life.

                                            Mencari :- 5W + 1H- Struktur- Kalimat langsung dan tidak langsungdari teks berita dibawahOn June 27, the Constitutional Court issued a unanimous verdict that the general election result was valid, and the claims of irregularities by the Prabowo Subianto camp were ungrounded. So, after a long process of a strenuous six months of campaigning and six weeks of protest rallies following the elections, the legality of the election of President Joko “Jokowi” Widodo was made official by the highest court, which in large measure was accepted by public opinion. Now it is time for President Jokowi to prepare his new cabinet. This time there will be no hurry as in 2014, because the presidential and vice presidential inauguration will only take place on Oct. 20. By now Jokowi has been president for almost five years, and obviously he is more experienced than when he was first elected in 2014. I suspect that in selecting the would-be ministers he would stress the expertise and experience of the candidates as the challenges he has to face are tremendous. The first challenge will be on the economic front due to the uncertainties in global and regional economic developments. Domestically, despite the achievements in the President’s first term, economic development was still uneven. If gross domestic product per capita will increase 5.5 percent annually (a normal achievement), then in 2024 it will reach US$5,000, while with 8 percent annual growth it will only reach $5,900 per capita, which was achieved by Iraq in 2018. For overall improvements in the economy, a series of policies are needed that are coherent and with all-encompassing objectiveness: Expansion of the workforce with adequate productivity; expansive macroeconomic policies for an open trade and investment regime; regulated best practices; innovative expansion of the private sector; promoting the growing small and medium enterprises sector, improving new energy to lower gas emissions; better policies for human resources development like health care, connectivity of all school levels, and creating business-minded graduates of tertiary education; improving the social security system; and promotion of massive digital investments in all sectors of life and in all fields. On democracy, observers have noted a number of challenges, among other things: political parties are facing an internal challenge to become less democratic; rampant corruption among the parties’ leadership and elite; high political costs due to the election system; increasing trends for intolerance at the expense of minority rights; the complexity of the bureaucracy; the overlapping functions of the State Secretariat, Cabinet Secretariat and the Law and Human Rights Ministry in legal matters. A case in point is the implementation of the regional autonomy regulations that have yet to be synchronized; also the necessary review of the role and professionalism of the Indonesian Military (TNI) in the midst of fast changing global dynamics. On foreign policy, there is a need to revisit some policies due to new challenges and developments regionally and globally. One critical need is a bigger role for the President to play in diplomacy. That includes his participation and presence in various international fora, which is highly important and vital. The appointment of the foreign minister in the new Cabinet will be very crucial. The foreign relations agenda needs a very able figure who has a good reputation at the regional and global level, and who is recognized as such by the diplomatic community. In facing the new demands and challenges in the coming five years, both domestically and externally, President Jokowi would need a new body that can assist him daily on strategic matters, related to the economy, politics and other issues, such as the National Security Council. Membership of the council consists of selective Cabinet ministers and heads of some state bodies. Another utterly important issue that needs special attention of the President is Papua with its very complex and multidimensional problems. One possible solution in sight is the establishment of a special body on Papua that is directly under the President, which has full authority with adequate means and funding to be successful. Most of the aforementioned issues and challenges are medium and long-term in nature, and President Jokowi is expected to handle them head on throughout his second term to bring about successful results of his two-term presidency.​</a>

                                            A. Read the following passage. What does the underlined word refer to? Myanmar state radio and television announced Tuesday that thecountry's president as granted amnesty to more than 6,300 prisoners in what appears to be the biggest step so far in a series of reform actions undertaken by the new elected government. The broadcasts said the releases would begin Wednesday - a religious holiday - but did not specify how many political detainees were among the 6,59 receiving an amnesty from President Thein Sein. The president set the decision after he had a meeting with the UN. The release of at least some of the country's estimated 2,000 political prisoners has been hotly anticipated as a crucial step in liberalizing measures implemented by the military-backed but elected government that took power in March. Most prominent political prisoners are held in facilities far from the country's main city of Yangon, a policy implemented under the previous military regime apparently to limit their ability to communicate through visiting family members and lawyers. The broadcast said a list of the prisoners had been prepared, but did not read out. Myanmar's tightly controlled state newspapers had published an appeal Tuesday morning for a release of political prisoners, a sign that the move had official blessing. The appeal in the three state newspapers, which closely reflect government positions, was an open letter from the government-appointed National Human Rights Commission calling on Thein Sein to grant an amnesty as a gesture of magnanimity. Myanmar's long-ruling military government handed power in March to an elected administration, which is seen as remaining closely aligned with the military but which has declared its intention to liberalize the country's hard line policies. The United States believes Myanmar's elections were flawed but has been encouraged by its liberalizing trend since the civilian administration took power, the highest-ranking American diplomat for Asia said Monday. 1.

                                            NELSON MANDELA	Nelson Mandela (1918-2013) was a South African political activist who spent over 20 years in prison for his opposition to the apartheid regime. He was released in 1990 and, in 1994, was later elected the first leader of a democratic South Africa. He was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1993 for his work in helping to end racial segregation in South Africa. He is considered the father of democratic South Africa and widely admired for his ability to bring together a nation, previously divided by apartheid. Nelson Mandela is one of the most admired political leaders of the Twentieth and Twenty First Century for his vision to forgive and forge a new ‘rainbow’ nation.	Nelson Mandela was born in Transkei, South Africa on July 18, 1918. He was the son of a local tribal leader of the Tembu tribe. As a youngster, Nelson took part in the activities and initiation ceremonies of his local tribe. However, unlike his father, Nelson Mandela gained a full education, studying at the University College of Fort Hare and also the University of Witwatersrand. Nelson was a good student and qualified with a law degree in 1942.	During his time at University, Nelson Mandela became increasingly aware of the racial inequality and injustice faced by non-white people. In 1943, he decided to join the ANC and actively take part in the struggle against apartheid. In 1956, Nelson Mandela, along with several other members of the ANC were arrested and charged with treason. After a lengthy and protracted court case the defendants were finally acquitted in 1961. However, with the ANC now banned, Nelson Mandela suggested an active armed resistance to the apartheid regime.	In 1963, Mandela was again arrested and put on trial for treason. This time the State succeeded in convicting Mandela and plotting to overthrow the government. Mandela’s death sentence was commuted to life imprisonment and from 1964-1981 he was incarcerated at Robben Island Prison, off Cape Town. In prison the conditions were sparse; however, Mandela was with many other political prisoners and there was a strong bond of friendship which helped to make more bearable the difficult prison conditions. Also, in prison Nelson Mandela was highly disciplined; he would try and study and take part in exercise every day.	Eventually, Nelson Mandela was released on February 11, 1990. The day was a huge event for South Africa and the world. His release is the symbolic of the impending end of apartheid. Following his release there followed protracted negotiations, (often interspersed with tribal violence). However, in April 1994, South Africa had its first full and fair elections. The ANC, with 65% of the vote, were elected and Nelson Mandela became the first President of the new South Africa. He died on December 5, 2013 after a long illness with his family at his side.

                                            The text is for questions 23 – 24 Nelson Mandela was a civil rights figure, who fought against apartheid, or racial discrimination against blacks, in South Africa. He spent 27 years in prison for his opposition to the apartheid regime. He was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1993 for his work in helping to end racial discrimination in South Africa. Nelson Mandela was born on July 18 in South Africa in 1918. He attended school and later studied at the College of Fort Hare and the University of Witwatersrand. He studied law at the University of Witwatersrand and got his law degree in 1942. During his time at University, he became increasingly aware of the racial injustice faced by non-white people and met his fellow activists against apartheid. In 1943, he decided to join the ANC (African National Congress) and actively took part in the struggle against apartheid. At first, he wanted the ANC to use non-violent protest methods. However, he began to doubt it. Later, after ANC was banned in 1960, he led a secret army called “Spear of the Nation”. Nelson Mandela was arrested and charged with treason several times. There was an international campaign for his release. Other countries stopped trading and playing sports with South Africa. Finally, Mandela was released from prison in 1990. His work paid off when all races were allowed to vote for the president in the 1994. He was voted as the first black President of South Africa. Then, he retired in 1999. He died on 5 December 2013 after a lung illness at 95.

"The traditional social system in the northern highlands was, in general, based on landownership and tenancy. after conquest, Menelik ll (reigned 1889-1913) impossed the north's imperial system on the conquered south. the government appointed many Amhara administrators who distributed land among themselves and relegated the indigeneous peasant to tenancy.the 1974 revolution swept away this strucsture of ethnic and class dominance. the provisional military Administrative council (PMAC;  also known as the derg) appointed representatives of the workers party of Ethiopia and the national system of peasant associations to implement land reform. additionally, the government organized urban centers into a hierarchy of urban dwellers associations (kebeles). despite these reforms, however, dissatisfaction and covert opposition to the regime continued in the civilian and military sectors."</a>

Description Prambanan temple is the biggest Hindu temple site in Asia. The building was completed in the mid-9th century during the regime of Sanjaya Dynasty. The history explains that Rakai Pikatan is the one who initiated the building of that giant temple. The original name of Prambanan temple is Shivagrha because the temple was built to dedicate to the God of Shiva. Equal with Borobudur temple, the Prambanan temple at every main building recognizes the three world hierarchy which spanned from the lower world to the holiest place. At the first level of the building symbolizes the lowest realm of the world.

                                            Abdul Hamid II was born on September 21, 1842. He is the 27’th Calif of Chaliphate of Turks, a global state of Moslem world. He spoke Turkish, Arabic, and Persian Language. He was appointed Calif on August 1876 at the age of 34. He appointed as Calif after the death of his cousin, Sultan Murad V. He inherited the power when the country was in chaos because of many problems. He ruled the states which territory stretching from Morocco to India.During his reign, the Jews were very ambitious to occupy Palestine, because they thought it belongs to them. But their ambition was never achieved because Abdul Hamid II stood up against their plans. On 1896, Theodore Hertzl, the founder of recent Israel, ventured to the Sultan Abdul Hamid as he requested permission to put up a building in al-Quds (Jerusalem). Sultan refused the request by reason that Palestine belongs to all Muslims, not him.The Jews were very angry. They thought that Ottoman Chaliphate and Abdul Hamid, it’s Calif, were the hindrance of their plan. The Jews then held a conference in Basel Switzerland, on 29-31 August 1897 in order to formulate new strategies undermine Ottoman Caliphate. In 1902, Hertzl for the second time came to the Sultan in order to bribe him. But for the umpteenth time Sultan resolutely refused, he even did not want to see Herztl.Since then, the Jews by Zionism launched a movement to overthrow the Sultan. They joined the United Kingdom to face the Sultan. They used their agent, Mustapha Kamal and his organization The Movement of Young Turks to create a public’s distrust towards sultan. By using the slogan “liberation”, “freedom”, and so on, the agents called the regime of Abdul Hamid II as “Hamidian absolutism.” The wests also spread many dangerous thought to the people of Ottoman Chaliphate. Nationalism is one of their weapon to break the unity of Chaliphate. In 1877, many provinces and regions in North Africa, Arabia, Armenia, Middle East and South Asia then wanted their independence from Ottoman Chaliphate.In April 27, 1909, the Chaliphate Senat in the pressure of Young Turks Movement decided to overthrow Sultan Abdul Hamid. Sultan Abdul Hamid then deposed and spent his last days at Beylerbeyi Palace in Bosphorus until his death in 1918. Jewish efforts finally succeeded through help of UK and their agent Mustafa Kamal, the founder of Republic of Turkey. They eventually occupied Palestinian territory in 1967.TOLONG TERJEMAHKAN KE INDONESIA MAKASIH SEBELUMNYA YANG SUDAH MAU BANTU </a>

                            6. THE ECONOMIC GROWTH AND THE REGIONAL CHARACTERISTICS: THE CASE OF INDONESIA
Indonesia’s economic growth is quite high but the effect on its people is low and raises questions about the influence of the regional characteristics on economic growth. The research of Sodik et al (2007) stated that the overall pattern of a region’s capacity is a result of the nature of social and economic environment that determines the pattern of activity in achieving objectives reflected in regional characteristics which influence economic growth in the form of aspects or qualities consisting of regional labor force, population, human capital (education), inflation and net exports.
Employment is a very important aspect to be studied. Countries with a very large number of people and the provision of limited employment opportunities face serious problems with unemployment. Developments in the labor force cannot be separated from the rate of population growth in the region. Tjiptoherijanto (2001) stated that during the period 1997-1999, the total work force in Indonesia tended to increase, either in working or looking for work. When viewed between the number of people working and those looking for work, it turned out the working population was relatively larger than those looking for work, but the increase was much higher for those in the population who are looking for work. In the construction, local residents often serve as a source of labor which addresses the problem of employment. Thus, with a population increase in Indonesia from year to year, while the number of jobs available can lead to limited competition, job seekers are threatened by the lack of opportunity and fulfillment of well-being by fear of increased poverty. As revealed by Ngangi (2010), overcoming poverty is not an easy task but it is closely related to life issues such as the state of the environment, a social activity, education level and health status. The quality of labor is reflected in part by the improvement of education. The higher the formal education obtained; the labor productivity tended to be higher as well. This is consistent with the theory of human capital (human capital). 
Sendouw (2006) stated that as a country, Indonesia is one country that has the greatest natural resources in the world, but it has not guaranteed improved welfare of its society. Nor is the use of its resources dependent on the age of the country, but reflected in the attitudes and behavior follow the principle - the basic principle of life. Attitudes and behaviors exhibited The Economic Growth and The Regional Characteristics : The Case of Indonesia 5 by human beings can be formed through a process of learning, especially in formal education, thus human capital follows the basic principles of life. 
The phenomenon of inflation in Indonesia has become one of the various “diseases” of the government macroeconomic which is especially troubling for the community. Towards the end of the New Order regime (before the financial crisis) the annual inflation rate could be reduced to the single digits, but in general it still contained vulnerability when seen from the large percentage of poor communities suffering from inflation. 
Since 1967, Indonesia tried to open up. Changing from an isolated system to an open system contains a dubious advantage. Indonesian net export value fluctuated over 2 decades and during the period from 2005 to 2010, Indonesia’s trade balance (net exports) experienced a trade surplus. Based on a review of several indicators of regional characteristics, the required study group should have similar characteristics as the region in order to gain an overall understanding of the factors that can be determined and identified through the analysis which presumably can spur economic growth in establishing a region.

                            7. A. Read the following passage, and answer the questions that follow.
Myanmar state radio and television announced Tuesday that (1) the country's president as granted amnesty to more than 6,300 prisoners in what appears to be the biggest step so far in a series of reform actions undertaken by the new elected government.
(2)The broadcasts said the releases would begin Wednesday - a religious holiday - but did not specify how many political detainees were among the 6,59 receiving an amnesty from President Thein Sein. The president set the decision after (3) he had a meeting with the UN. The release of at least some of the country's estimated 2,000 political prisoners has been hotly anticipated as a crucial step in liberalizing measures implemented by the military-backed but elected government that took power in March.
Most prominent political prisoners are held in facilities far from the country's main city of Yangon, a policy implemented under the previous military regime apparently to limit (4) their ability to communicate through visiting family members and lawyers.
The broadcast said a list of the prisoners had been prepared, but did not read out. Myanmar's tightly controlled state newspapers had published an appeal Tuesday morning for a release of political prisoners, a sign that the move had official blessing.
The appeal in the three state newspapers, which closely reflect government positions, was an open letter from the government-appointed National Human Rights Commission calling on Thein Sein to grant an amnesty as a gesture of magnanimity.
Myanmar's long-ruling military government handed power in March to an elected administration, which is seen as remaining closely aligned with the military but which has declared (5) its  intention to liberalize the country's hard line policies.
The United States believes Myanmar's elections were flawed but has been encouraged by its liberalizing trend since the civilian administration took power, the highest-ranking American diplomat for Asia said Monday.

Fort Rotterdam is rectangular. To protect the fort, six bulwarks, namely Bastion Bonie, Bastion Boeton, Bastion Batjang, Bastion Mandassar, Bastion Ravelin (not visible anymore), and Bastion Amboina, were built around the fort to protect it. Today, inside the fort, we can find La Galigo Museum which stores many relics of the kingdoms in Sulawesi island. The fort is well-preserved to attract visitors. The most interesting place in this fort is a room where Prince Diponegoro was imprisoned for life.

                            12. Mencari :- 5W + 1H- Struktur- Kalimat langsung dan tidak langsungdari teks berita dibawahOn June 27, the Constitutional Court issued a unanimous verdict that the general election result was valid, and the claims of irregularities by the Prabowo Subianto camp were ungrounded. So, after a long process of a strenuous six months of campaigning and six weeks of protest rallies following the elections, the legality of the election of President Joko “Jokowi” Widodo was made official by the highest court, which in large measure was accepted by public opinion. Now it is time for President Jokowi to prepare his new cabinet. This time there will be no hurry as in 2014, because the presidential and vice presidential inauguration will only take place on Oct. 20. By now Jokowi has been president for almost five years, and obviously he is more experienced than when he was first elected in 2014. I suspect that in selecting the would-be ministers he would stress the expertise and experience of the candidates as the challenges he has to face are tremendous. The first challenge will be on the economic front due to the uncertainties in global and regional economic developments. Domestically, despite the achievements in the President’s first term, economic development was still uneven. If gross domestic product per capita will increase 5.5 percent annually (a normal achievement), then in 2024 it will reach US$5,000, while with 8 percent annual growth it will only reach $5,900 per capita, which was achieved by Iraq in 2018. For overall improvements in the economy, a series of policies are needed that are coherent and with all-encompassing objectiveness: Expansion of the workforce with adequate productivity; expansive macroeconomic policies for an open trade and investment regime; regulated best practices; innovative expansion of the private sector; promoting the growing small and medium enterprises sector, improving new energy to lower gas emissions; better policies for human resources development like health care, connectivity of all school levels, and creating business-minded graduates of tertiary education; improving the social security system; and promotion of massive digital investments in all sectors of life and in all fields. On democracy, observers have noted a number of challenges, among other things: political parties are facing an internal challenge to become less democratic; rampant corruption among the parties’ leadership and elite; high political costs due to the election system; increasing trends for intolerance at the expense of minority rights; the complexity of the bureaucracy; the overlapping functions of the State Secretariat, Cabinet Secretariat and the Law and Human Rights Ministry in legal matters. A case in point is the implementation of the regional autonomy regulations that have yet to be synchronized; also the necessary review of the role and professionalism of the Indonesian Military (TNI) in the midst of fast changing global dynamics. On foreign policy, there is a need to revisit some policies due to new challenges and developments regionally and globally. One critical need is a bigger role for the President to play in diplomacy. That includes his participation and presence in various international fora, which is highly important and vital. The appointment of the foreign minister in the new Cabinet will be very crucial. The foreign relations agenda needs a very able figure who has a good reputation at the regional and global level, and who is recognized as such by the diplomatic community. In facing the new demands and challenges in the coming five years, both domestically and externally, President Jokowi would need a new body that can assist him daily on strategic matters, related to the economy, politics and other issues, such as the National Security Council. Membership of the council consists of selective Cabinet ministers and heads of some state bodies. Another utterly important issue that needs special attention of the President is Papua with its very complex and multidimensional problems. One possible solution in sight is the establishment of a special body on Papua that is directly under the President, which has full authority with adequate means and funding to be successful. Most of the aforementioned issues and challenges are medium and long-term in nature, and President Jokowi is expected to handle them head on throughout his second term to bring about successful results of his two-term presidency.​</h2><br />

                            15. A. Read the following passage. What does the underlined word refer to? Myanmar state radio and television announced Tuesday that thecountry's president as granted amnesty to more than 6,300 prisoners in what appears to be the biggest step so far in a series of reform actions undertaken by the new elected government. The broadcasts said the releases would begin Wednesday - a religious holiday - but did not specify how many political detainees were among the 6,59 receiving an amnesty from President Thein Sein. The president set the decision after he had a meeting with the UN. The release of at least some of the country's estimated 2,000 political prisoners has been hotly anticipated as a crucial step in liberalizing measures implemented by the military-backed but elected government that took power in March. Most prominent political prisoners are held in facilities far from the country's main city of Yangon, a policy implemented under the previous military regime apparently to limit their ability to communicate through visiting family members and lawyers. The broadcast said a list of the prisoners had been prepared, but did not read out. Myanmar's tightly controlled state newspapers had published an appeal Tuesday morning for a release of political prisoners, a sign that the move had official blessing. The appeal in the three state newspapers, which closely reflect government positions, was an open letter from the government-appointed National Human Rights Commission calling on Thein Sein to grant an amnesty as a gesture of magnanimity. Myanmar's long-ruling military government handed power in March to an elected administration, which is seen as remaining closely aligned with the military but which has declared its intention to liberalize the country's hard line policies. The United States believes Myanmar's elections were flawed but has been encouraged by its liberalizing trend since the civilian administration took power, the highest-ranking American diplomat for Asia said Monday. 1.

                            23. NELSON MANDELA	Nelson Mandela (1918-2013) was a South African political activist who spent over 20 years in prison for his opposition to the apartheid regime. He was released in 1990 and, in 1994, was later elected the first leader of a democratic South Africa. He was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1993 for his work in helping to end racial segregation in South Africa. He is considered the father of democratic South Africa and widely admired for his ability to bring together a nation, previously divided by apartheid. Nelson Mandela is one of the most admired political leaders of the Twentieth and Twenty First Century for his vision to forgive and forge a new ‘rainbow’ nation.	Nelson Mandela was born in Transkei, South Africa on July 18, 1918. He was the son of a local tribal leader of the Tembu tribe. As a youngster, Nelson took part in the activities and initiation ceremonies of his local tribe. However, unlike his father, Nelson Mandela gained a full education, studying at the University College of Fort Hare and also the University of Witwatersrand. Nelson was a good student and qualified with a law degree in 1942.	During his time at University, Nelson Mandela became increasingly aware of the racial inequality and injustice faced by non-white people. In 1943, he decided to join the ANC and actively take part in the struggle against apartheid. In 1956, Nelson Mandela, along with several other members of the ANC were arrested and charged with treason. After a lengthy and protracted court case the defendants were finally acquitted in 1961. However, with the ANC now banned, Nelson Mandela suggested an active armed resistance to the apartheid regime.	In 1963, Mandela was again arrested and put on trial for treason. This time the State succeeded in convicting Mandela and plotting to overthrow the government. Mandela’s death sentence was commuted to life imprisonment and from 1964-1981 he was incarcerated at Robben Island Prison, off Cape Town. In prison the conditions were sparse; however, Mandela was with many other political prisoners and there was a strong bond of friendship which helped to make more bearable the difficult prison conditions. Also, in prison Nelson Mandela was highly disciplined; he would try and study and take part in exercise every day.	Eventually, Nelson Mandela was released on February 11, 1990. The day was a huge event for South Africa and the world. His release is the symbolic of the impending end of apartheid. Following his release there followed protracted negotiations, (often interspersed with tribal violence). However, in April 1994, South Africa had its first full and fair elections. The ANC, with 65% of the vote, were elected and Nelson Mandela became the first President of the new South Africa. He died on December 5, 2013 after a long illness with his family at his side.

                            24. The text is for questions 23 – 24 Nelson Mandela was a civil rights figure, who fought against apartheid, or racial discrimination against blacks, in South Africa. He spent 27 years in prison for his opposition to the apartheid regime. He was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1993 for his work in helping to end racial discrimination in South Africa. Nelson Mandela was born on July 18 in South Africa in 1918. He attended school and later studied at the College of Fort Hare and the University of Witwatersrand. He studied law at the University of Witwatersrand and got his law degree in 1942. During his time at University, he became increasingly aware of the racial injustice faced by non-white people and met his fellow activists against apartheid. In 1943, he decided to join the ANC (African National Congress) and actively took part in the struggle against apartheid. At first, he wanted the ANC to use non-violent protest methods. However, he began to doubt it. Later, after ANC was banned in 1960, he led a secret army called “Spear of the Nation”. Nelson Mandela was arrested and charged with treason several times. There was an international campaign for his release. Other countries stopped trading and playing sports with South Africa. Finally, Mandela was released from prison in 1990. His work paid off when all races were allowed to vote for the president in the 1994. He was voted as the first black President of South Africa. Then, he retired in 1999. He died on 5 December 2013 after a lung illness at 95.

                            35. Abdul Hamid II was born on September 21, 1842. He is the 27’th Calif of Chaliphate of Turks, a global state of Moslem world. He spoke Turkish, Arabic, and Persian Language. He was appointed Calif on August 1876 at the age of 34. He appointed as Calif after the death of his cousin, Sultan Murad V. He inherited the power when the country was in chaos because of many problems. He ruled the states which territory stretching from Morocco to India.During his reign, the Jews were very ambitious to occupy Palestine, because they thought it belongs to them. But their ambition was never achieved because Abdul Hamid II stood up against their plans. On 1896, Theodore Hertzl, the founder of recent Israel, ventured to the Sultan Abdul Hamid as he requested permission to put up a building in al-Quds (Jerusalem). Sultan refused the request by reason that Palestine belongs to all Muslims, not him.The Jews were very angry. They thought that Ottoman Chaliphate and Abdul Hamid, it’s Calif, were the hindrance of their plan. The Jews then held a conference in Basel Switzerland, on 29-31 August 1897 in order to formulate new strategies undermine Ottoman Caliphate. In 1902, Hertzl for the second time came to the Sultan in order to bribe him. But for the umpteenth time Sultan resolutely refused, he even did not want to see Herztl.Since then, the Jews by Zionism launched a movement to overthrow the Sultan. They joined the United Kingdom to face the Sultan. They used their agent, Mustapha Kamal and his organization The Movement of Young Turks to create a public’s distrust towards sultan. By using the slogan “liberation”, “freedom”, and so on, the agents called the regime of Abdul Hamid II as “Hamidian absolutism.” The wests also spread many dangerous thought to the people of Ottoman Chaliphate. Nationalism is one of their weapon to break the unity of Chaliphate. In 1877, many provinces and regions in North Africa, Arabia, Armenia, Middle East and South Asia then wanted their independence from Ottoman Chaliphate.In April 27, 1909, the Chaliphate Senat in the pressure of Young Turks Movement decided to overthrow Sultan Abdul Hamid. Sultan Abdul Hamid then deposed and spent his last days at Beylerbeyi Palace in Bosphorus until his death in 1918. Jewish efforts finally succeeded through help of UK and their agent Mustafa Kamal, the founder of Republic of Turkey. They eventually occupied Palestinian territory in 1967.TOLONG TERJEMAHKAN KE INDONESIA MAKASIH SEBELUMNYA YANG SUDAH MAU BANTU </h2><br />
                        <p>Abdul Hamid II lahir pada 21 September 1842. Ia adalah Calif ke-27 dari Chaliphate Turki, sebuah negara dunia Muslim global. Dia berbicara bahasa Turki, Arab, dan Persia. Dia ditunjuk sebagai Calif pada Agustus 1876 pada usia 34. Dia ditunjuk sebagai Calif setelah kematian sepupunya, Sultan Murad V. Dia mewarisi kekuatan ketika negara itu dalam kekacauan karena banyak masalah. Dia memerintah negara-negara bagian yang membentang dari Maroko ke India.</p><br /><p>Selama masa pemerintahannya, orang-orang Yahudi sangat berambisi untuk menduduki Palestina, karena mereka pikir itu milik mereka. Tetapi ambisi mereka tidak pernah tercapai karena Abdul Hamid II menentang rencana mereka. Pada 1896, Theodore Hertzl, pendiri Israel baru-baru ini, pergi ke Sultan Abdul Hamid ketika ia meminta izin untuk membangun sebuah bangunan di al-Quds (Yerusalem). Sultan menolak permintaan itu dengan alasan bahwa Palestina adalah milik semua Muslim, bukan dia.</p><br /><p>Orang-orang Yahudi sangat marah. Mereka berpikir bahwa Khalifah Ottoman dan Abdul Hamid, Calif, adalah penghalang rencana mereka. Orang-orang Yahudi kemudian mengadakan konferensi di Basel Swiss, pada 29-31 Agustus 1897 untuk merumuskan strategi baru yang melemahkan Kekhalifahan Utsmaniyah. Pada tahun 1902, Hertzl untuk kedua kalinya mendatangi Sultan untuk menyuapnya. Tetapi untuk kesekian kalinya Sultan dengan tegas menolak, ia bahkan tidak ingin melihat Herztl.</p><br /><p>Sejak itu, kaum Yahudi oleh Zionisme melancarkan gerakan untuk menggulingkan Sultan. Mereka bergabung dengan Inggris untuk menghadapi Sultan. Mereka menggunakan agen mereka, Mustapha Kamal dan organisasinya "Gerakan Muda Turki" untuk menciptakan ketidakpercayaan publik terhadap sultan. Dengan menggunakan slogan "pembebasan", "kebebasan", dan seterusnya, para agen menyebut rezim Abdul Hamid II sebagai "Hamid yang Mutlak". Barat juga menyebarkan banyak pemikiran berbahaya kepada orang-orang dari Khilafah Utsmaniyah. Nasionalisme adalah salah satu senjata mereka untuk menghancurkan persatuan Khalifah. Pada tahun 1877, banyak provinsi dan wilayah di Afrika Utara, Arab, Armenia, Timur Tengah dan Asia Selatan kemudian menginginkan kemerdekaan mereka dari Khilafah Utsmaniyah.</p><br /><p>Pada tanggal 27 April 1909, Chaliphate Senat dalam tekanan Gerakan Muda Turki memutuskan untuk menggulingkan Sultan Abdul Hamid. Sultan Abdul Hamid kemudian digulingkan dan menghabiskan hari-hari terakhirnya di Istana Beylerbeyi di Bosphorus sampai kematiannya pada tahun 1918. Upaya Yahudi akhirnya berhasil melalui bantuan Inggris dan agen mereka Mustafa Kamal, pendiri Republik Turki. Mereka akhirnya menduduki wilayah Palestina pada tahun 1967.</p><br /><p><strong>Semoga membantu, ya....^-^</strong></p><br />
